This repo will contain all the algos I've implemented on my journey into learning Algorithms and Data Structures


As for now I have implemented: 

- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Find maximum subarray
- Selection Sort
- Binary Search

From what i've learned unil now, the time comlexities of the most famous algos are :

Algorithms and their time complexity (**Worst case**)
---
- InsertionSort   O($n^2$)
- MergeSort       O(n log n)
- SelectionSort   O($n^2$)
- BinarySearch    O(logn)
- QuickSort       O($n^2$ or in normal case O(n logn))
- Lists
- Queues
- Stacks
- BinaryTrees
